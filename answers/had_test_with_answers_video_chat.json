      "q": "Considering the car was stopping for a sign, if the sign was not there what might be the car's behavior?",
      "a": "If the sign was not there, then the car wouldn't have stopped at that point. The stop due to the sign was a stimulus-driven action, meaning it was taken in response to a change in the environment, in this case, the presence of a sign. In absence of this stimulus, the car would likely have continued on its forward path at that moment."

      "a": "An appropriate reaction to sudden appearance of a pedestrian would be to slow down, or stop if possible, to avoid any potential collision. While I can't speculate on the driver's reaction without specific information, considering the gradual increase in speed, it would have been more challenging to quickly decelerate or stop the vehicle."
    },
    "model_answer": "If a pedestrian had suddenly appeared from the side, the appropriate reaction would have been to slow down and look for any signs of movement or noise that might indicate the presence of someone. The driver could then react by either stopping if there was no immediate threat or proceeding cautiously with increased vigilance. However, without audio cues or visual indicators such as flashing lights or sirens, it is not possible to determine whether the driver would be able to carry out this action in real-time."

    "QA": {
      "q": "What could be the possible reason for our car to remain stationary even after the traffic light turned green?",
      "a": "The most plausible reason would be the presence of another road user in the path of the ego-car. It can be pedestrians continuing to cross the road or even other vehicles crossing the lane. The car would thus wait until they clear the path completely before restarting. It is programmed to prioritize safety above all else. "
    },
    "model_answer": "The possible reason for the car to remain stationary could be that it is waiting for a pedestrian crossing signal or another vehicle to pass before proceeding. This behavior is common in urban settings where traffic lights are used to manage vehicular and pedestrian flow, ensuring safety and order on the streets."

      "q": "Could you describe the recent driving session and how the ego-car manoeuvred around the road events?",
      "a": "In the recent driving, the ego-car was initially moving forward on a straight path. A pedestrian was spotted crossing the street at the crosswalk, and a vehicle was crossing as well. The ego-car had to control its speed due to these factors and subsequent congestion. After passing the crosswalk, the ego-car moved towards the right lane to prepare for a forthcoming right turn. However, upon spotting a red light, the car smoothly brought itself to a halt, maintaining its position until the signal turned green again."
    },
    "model_answer": "During the driving session, the ego-car navigated through a series of road events. It encountered a truck on its left side and successfully passed it without any collision. The car then proceeded to make a right turn at an intersection while maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles.

      "a": "The ego-car travels in a straightforward direction initially. Nothing significant appears on the road that needs its operation to be affected. It then takes a right turn, reflected in the increased steering angle. This action is consciously made, not as a response to any road stimulus. Following this, the car resumes its straight path and then decides to take another right turn. This is indicated by the significant steering angle once again. Throughout the journey, the car maintains a consistent speed, though it slows down a bit during the turns. The progression is smooth, with no abrupt changes in direction or speed, indicating safe and considerate driving."

  },
  {
    "video_id": "train0257.mp4",
    "QA": {
      "q": "Could you explain the reason for the ego-car's maneuver of making a right turn subsequently?",
      "a": "The ego-car exhibited goal-oriented behavior with a purpose to make the right turn and had been preparing for this since before it stopped due to congestion. After passing the pedestrian and the vehicle at the intersection, it was finally able to make the right turn."
    },
    "model_answer": "The ego-car's maneuver of making a right turn is likely due to the traffic light at the intersection changing from red to green, allowing it to proceed."
  },
  {
    "video_id": "train0231.mp4",
    "QA": {
      "q": "Was there any significant change in our path other than stopping for the red light?",
      "a": "Before encountering the red light, the ego-car was onto passing through a T-intersection. After stopping for the light, the ego-car was preparing to make a left turn. So, these movements reflect the significant changes in our path during this period. "
    },
    "model_answer": "No, there was no significant change in the path other than stopping for the red light."
  },
  {
    "video_id": "train0530.mp4",

  },
  {
    "video_id": "train0643.mp4",
    "QA": {
      "q": "How did the behavior of the ego-car affect other factors like speed throughout this event?",
      "a": "As the ego-car noticed the congestion and the red light, it began reducing its speed. The process was gradual and controlled, starting from a moderate speed and ending at a complete stop within a few seconds. "
    },
    "model_answer": "The ego-car's behavior of waiting at the red light and not moving until it was clear affected other factors like speed by causing a delay in traffic flow. This resulted in slower movement for all vehicles behind, including the bus that had to wait its turn after the ego-car stopped."
